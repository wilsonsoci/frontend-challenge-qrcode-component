### What I learned

Useful Code Samples:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-shadow: 0 0 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);
}

@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    .container {
        max-width: 100%;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my HTML divisions and CSS Flexbox!
